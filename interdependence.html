As a result, he was rewarded with a small kingdom of his own to rule.</p><p class="text">About 10 years later, Sargon I was conscripting warriors for a new war.  Sostoras was obligated to send a detachment of soldiers to aid Sargon I.  He had to decide who to put in command of the detachment.  After thinking about it for a long time, Sostoras eventually decided on Tiglath who was a member of his family.  This appointment had several advantages.  Sostoras was able to show his loyalty to his family.  He was also able to cement their loyalty to him.  In addition, having Tiglath as the commander increased the power and prestige of the family.  Finally, if Tiglath performed well, Sargon I would be indebted to the family.</p>
